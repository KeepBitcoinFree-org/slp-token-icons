Attach the logos to this pull-request in 32x32, 64x64, 128x128 and svg.

Ensure the SVG file is a proper vector file and not just embedding a PNG/JPEG file. If the SVG source contains `data:image/png;base64`/`data:image/jpeg;base64` or its size is larger than 100 KB, it's not a valid vectorized SVG file.
